Private Cloud(Startalk SDK)
=====
Private Cloud is a way for decentralized deployment. Customers or enterprises would deploy the back end code on their own servers, embedding SDK into their own app. Every enterprise is an independent node; every node works independently, and the data would only be saved in the node.  

Please see the guide of embedding Android SDK and the configuration below.

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0 or later
- Xcode 10.0 or later

- For details about how to use the library and clear examples, see [The detailed How to use](https://github.com/startalkIM/imsdk-ios/wiki/QIMSDK-iOS%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E)

## Installation

There are four ways to use QIMSDK in your project:
- using CocoaPods
- manual install (build frameworks or embed Xcode Project)

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects. See the [Get Started](http://cocoapods.org/#get_started) section for more details.

#### Podfile
```
source 'https://github.com/qunarcorp/libqimkit-ios-cook.git'
source 'git@github.com:CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
pod 'QIMUIKit', '~> 4.0'
```

### Manual Installation Guide

See more on [Manual install Guide](https://github.com/startalkIM/imsdk-ios/wiki/QIMSDK-iOS-%E6%8E%A5%E5%85%A5%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3)

### Import headers in your source files

In the source files where you need to use the library, import the umbrella header file:

```objective-c
#import "QIMSDK.h"
```

### Build Project

At this point your workspace should build without error. If you are having problem, post to the Issue and the
community can help you solve it.
