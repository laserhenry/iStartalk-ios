//Represents a client’s request to join a room. If the room does not exist, it is created. To obtain the available rooms, the client should previously use the REST method getAllRooms.

//Represents a client’s request to start streaming her local media to anyone inside the room. The user can use the SDP answer from the response to display her local media after having passed through the KMS server (as opposed or besides using just the local stream), and thus check what other users in the room are receiving from her stream. The loopback can be enabled using the corresponding parameter.

//Method: publishVideo
//Parameters:
//

//
//sender: id of the publisher’s endpoint, build by appending the publisher’s name and her currently opened stream (usually webcam)
//sdpOffer: SDP offer sent by this client

//Send ICE Candidate
//Request that carries info about an ICE candidate gathered on the client side. This information is required to implement the trickle ICE mechanism. Should be sent whenever an ICECandidate event is created by a RTCPeerConnection.

//
//endpointName: the name of the peer whose ICE candidate was found
//candidate: the candidate attribute information
//sdpMLineIndex: the index (starting at zero) of the m-line in the SDP this candidate is associated with
//sdpMid: media stream identification, “audio” or “video”, for the m-line this candidate is associated with
